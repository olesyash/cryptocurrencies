## Description

 Blockchain Implementation Exercise

This exercise implements a basic blockchain system with the following key components:

## Components

### Node
- Represents a participant in the blockchain network
- Maintains a copy of the blockchain
- Manages unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs)
- Handles transaction validation and propagation
- Implements mining functionality
- Manages peer-to-peer connections

### Block
- Contains a list of transactions
- Links to previous block via hash
- Includes mining rewards (coinbase transactions)
- Has a maximum size limit (BLOCK_SIZE)

### Transaction
- Represents transfer of coins between addresses
- Contains input (previous transaction), output (recipient), and signature
- Special case: Coinbase transactions for mining rewards

## Key Features

1. **Transaction Validation**
   - Signature verification
   - Double-spend prevention
   - UTXO tracking
   - Mempool management

2. **Block Validation**
   - Size limits
   - Transaction validity
   - Previous hash verification
   - Coinbase transaction rules

3. **Network Protocol**
   - Peer discovery and connection
   - Block propagation
   - Transaction propagation
   - Chain synchronization

4. **Consensus Rules**
   - Longest chain selection
   - Fork resolution
   - Genesis block handling

5. **Security Features**
   - Cryptographic signatures
   - Hash-based block linking
   - Double-spend protection
   - Invalid transaction rejection

## Implementation Details

- Uses Ed25519 for cryptographic operations
- SHA256 for block and transaction hashing
- Maximum block size of 10 transactions
- Supports network partitioning and reorganization
- Handles various edge cases (invalid blocks, double spends, etc.)

## Usage

The system can be used to:
1. Create and manage blockchain nodes
2. Send transactions between addresses
3. Mine new blocks
4. Maintain network connections
5. Validate and propagate blockchain data

## Security Considerations

The implementation includes protections against:
- Double spending
- Invalid signatures
- Chain reorganization attacks
- Block size manipulation
- Invalid transaction propagation
- Duplicate transactions within blocks
- Invalid coinbase transactions
